# machine-learning-intro
Introductory project to Linear Models, Decision Trees and Ensemble Methods. It includes various ways to train a model and covers the most significant theories of basic machine learning, such as:

- **Overfitting**: the most common ways to face this issue are provided, with detailed explanation and documentation.
- **Model-tuning**: finding the best parameters for the model, while avoiding overfitting.
- **Evaluation**: various evaluation methods such as cross-validation.
- **Data-preprocessing**: handling of missing and categorical values, one hot encoding and normalization.

**Instructions**: To run each demo, you will need the appropriate dataset, which can be found under the **data** directory and inside the folder corresponding to the demo you are running.
